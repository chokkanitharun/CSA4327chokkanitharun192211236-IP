**Alarm Clock Application**
This is a simple web-based alarm clock application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The alarm clock features a running digital clock face that shows the user's current time  as well as providing a interactive alarm feature. The user is able to select a time for the alarm to go off and can set or cancel the alarm.

When the set alarm time is reached, the web plays an audible alarm as well as displaying visual indicator of the alarm.

I use this alarm clock web daily, keeping it open in a web browser to set alarms for meeting reminders or setting productivity timers when working from home. I prefer using this app now over setting alarms on a phone for ease of use.
